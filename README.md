### Description
A Rain World mod that adds a game controller to Five Pebbles' room. If slugcat grabs it, slugcat can control Five Pebbles' puppet.

The goal is to use the code from Breakout from Five Pebbles Pong:

And apply it to generally all directions and not draw game UI.

If you find a bug, please do not report it on [the upstream issues page](https://github.com/woutkolkman/fivepebblespong/issues), as it's probably the horrible code of my fork that's causing your issues, *unless* it's still present on the original.
